                    In the campaign mode of Need for Speed Unbound, players embark 
                    on an adrenaline-fueled journey through the fictional streets of 
                    Lakeshore City. The story centers around high-stakes street 
                    racing, where players build their reputation, earn cash, and 
                    customize their dream cars. Along the way, they must outsmart 
                    rival racers and evade the relentless police. The campaign is 
                    structured around weekly qualifiers leading to the ultimate 
                    racing showdown, offering an engaging mix of narrative progression 
                    and intense gameplay. Each decision, whether upgrading your car or 
                    managing your winnings shapes your path to becoming the ultimate 
                    street racing champion.

            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="content-header">Online</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    The online mode of Need for Speed Unbound offers a dynamic and 
                    competitive multiplayer experience, setting it apart from the 
                    narrative-driven campaign. In this mode, players join an open 
                    world shared with others, engaging in spontaneous races, 
                    challenges, and collaborations. Unlike the campaign, the online 
                    version focuses less on story and more on player interaction, 
                    customization, and skill. Progression in the online mode involves 
                    earning currency to upgrade and personalize vehicles while competing 
                    for leaderboard spots and bragging rights. The absence of police chases 
                    during free roam creates a more relaxed environment for exploration, 
                    but races still deliver the thrill of intense competition.
